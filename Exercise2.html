    <h1>Difference between absolute and relative positioning.</h1>
    <br />
    <p>
      <b>Relative Positioning:</b>When you set an element's position to
      relative, it is positioned relative to its normal position in the document
      flow. The element will still occupy space in the document flow as if it
      were not positioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Absolute Positioning:</b> When you set an element's position to
      absolute, it is positioned relative to its nearest positioned (not static)
      ancestor element. If there is no positioned ancestor, it is positioned
      relative to the initial containing block, which is usually the body
      element.
